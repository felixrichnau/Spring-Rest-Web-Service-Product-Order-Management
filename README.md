/* Fill in this readme, you are missing a lot of important things:
1. How do I download this project from github and get all dependencies correctly?
I tried it myself now and I got an exception when trying to run it:
java.sql.SQLException: Access denied for user 'root'@'localhost' (using password: NO)
2. How is this project run? From what folder or what class? Does it need to be done as 
 a root user? If I need to download dependencies then where do I get those? I guess you
 use the pom.xml so maybe just saying that is enough.
3. Explain the scope of the project. If you been given an assignment, writing 
what the assignment actually is would probably be good. Especially if you want
others to see it and give feedback.
